### Description

![Alt text](preview.png)

This project was to show that I can take an already created website and make it into a Progressive Web App. A Progressive Web is an offline web app which is an exact copy of the website. Making this text editor a PWA shows future employers that I can make a PWA and still have it be functional.

### Installation

Type "npm i" in order to install Webpack, babel, concurrently, node and other packages used in making this application.

### Usage

The intended usage for this project is to edit any text you may have. It is used similar to Word or Google Docs

### Credits

Thank you to Erik Hirsh and Andrew Hardemon for helping me troubleshoot display errors due to Webpack being extremely picky.

### Testing

The testing used in this application was mainly checking the console and going through any errors that popped up.
